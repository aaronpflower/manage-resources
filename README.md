#Sample Angular App
>Allows a user to manage their favorite learning resources

>This was a fun challenge to do because as a developer I always enjoy learning new tools and frameworks, such as Angular in this case. I have worked on projects that have ranged from static informative websites using JQuery, vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS (vanilla CSS, Stylus, and LESS). I have also contributed to NodeJS applications using MithrilJS or React combined with Redux for the front end and PostgreSQL and MongoDB for the backend. So as I gain experience I have realized that there isnâ€™t one way to create an web application and each project takes careful consideration of the requirements to pick the right tool for the job.
